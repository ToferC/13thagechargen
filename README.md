# 13th Age Character Generator

This is a learning project that I do with most languages to start figuring out the ins and outs using subject matter that I know pretty intimately - role playing games.

Stuff that I usually figure out in the project:
* JSON string manipulation
* Save / Load files
* OS / File manipulation
* Random number generation
* CLI commands and queries
* String manipulation
* Structs / Classes
* Functions
* Error handling
* Probably more, but it's late.

Next steps:
- Web App serving
- Database - Postgres connection
- Graphql + Go + React
- More CLI
- GUIs
- Docker as dev environment
